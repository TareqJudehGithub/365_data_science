  Difference between Analysis and Analytics
   People confuse Analysis with Analytics due to lack of transparent
   understanding of both. 
   
    Analysis 
     - Analysis is to separate big data into small groups, to study them
       individually, and examine how they relate to other parts.
     - Analysis applies to things that happened in the past, like studying
       an decrease in sales last summer.
     

     Analytics
      - Analytics explore potential future events.
      - Analytics studies are based on past analysis.
      - Analytics branches into two areas:
          1. Qualitative
            Using intuition and experience in conjunction with the analysis, to
            plan your next Business move. An example for qualitative is to decide
            which product is trending and put it on the market for customers

          2. Quantitative 
            Formulas and algorithms gathered from our analysis. An example of
            quantitative analytics is to find out based or studies using formulas
            and algorithms WHEN (like which month) would be best to put that 
            product on the market.
          
      We can also combine qualitative analysis to explain how or why past events
      ended the way they did (like an increase in expenses the last quarter of
      last year). And quantitative analysis working on past data to explain why 
      sales decreased last summer.

     
     - Business Case Studies, Preliminary Data Report, Reporting with Visuals, 
     Creating Dashboards refer to activities that aim to explain past behavior.

     - Business Analytics, Qualitative Analytics, and Sales Forecasting refer to 
     activities used for predicting future behavior.

     - Data Analytics term refers to both data analysis and analytic.

     Data Science (DS)

     Data Science VS Data analytics

      - Data Science is a discipline reliant on data availability, while business
        analytics does not completely rely on data.
      - Data Science mostly the part that uses complex mathematical, statical and
        programming tools.

      - Data Science can be used to improve the accuracy of predictions based on 
        data extracted from various activities typical for work progress efficiency.
        And that certainly isn't business analytics.
      
     
     Business Intelligence (BI)
      Business Intelligence (BI) is the process of analyzing and reporting 
      historical business data, after reports and dashboards had been prepared.
      BI can be used to form strategic and business decisions by end-users, such
      as the GM.
      - BI aims to explain past events using business data.
      - BI refers to activities that aim to explain past behavior.
      - BI is a DS tool; because it is a preliminary step of predictive analytics.
      - BI analyses past data and extract useful insights.
      - BI creates appropriate models.
      

     Preliminary data
     - Preliminary data report is the first step of any data analysis.
     - Preliminary data report is considered as data science.
     

     Reporting with Visuals and Creating Dashboards
      - Reporting with Visuals and Creating Dashboards goe under BI.
      - Reporting with Visuals and Creating Dashboards are data science.


     Machine Learning (ML)
      - ML is the ability to predict outcomes without being explicitly programmed.
      - ML is about creating and implementing algorithms that let machines receive
        data and use this data to:
          - Make predictions
          - Analyse patterns
          - Give recommendations on their own
      - ML is under Data analytics; because it cannot be implemented without data.
      - Client retention. ML helps develop models that predict what a Client's 
        next purchase would be.
      - Fraud Prevention. ML can help prevent huge amount of fraud activities.
      - Speech Recognition
      - Image Recognition


     Artificial Intelligence (AI)
      - AI is simulating human knowledge and decision making with computers
      - How tools from ML can help us improve the accuracy of our estimations.
      - Symbolic Reasoning. Symbolic Reasoning is based on high-level human readable
        representation of problems and logic.
